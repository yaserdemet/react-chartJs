          explanation="Passing Object as a dependency to useEffect dependency array...
          The best approach to pass contents of an object used within the effect hook to dependency array is to pass the individual keys of the object as dependencies. This way the useEffect re renders when any of these values is updated.       
          But there are some case where the warning would keep coming until the object as a whole is passes in the dependency array.         
          Passing objects as dependencies in useEffect() would only hide linter warnings but would create a bigger problem than the previous warnings to add it as dependency. This might cause unnecessary re render that might eventually crash the app due to memory issues because the object position in memory would keep changing each time the component is mounted and updated causing the useEffect to see it as an update in the object even if the content of the object is not changing.
          One way to go around this issue is to stringify the object, and allowing its contents act as strings in the useEffect dependency array, in this case the useEffect would re render only if any of the object properties change. This is more stable than passing an object as dependencies.
          However, this method is not a silver bullet to solving useEffect dependencies issue with object as it would not work for deeply nested objects.
          To solve issues with deeply nested object, you can write your own object comparison logic or use the lodash library."
